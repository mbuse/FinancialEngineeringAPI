Financial Engineering API
=========================

Real hot stuff like Pricing of American PUT Options on Futures of Zero Coupon Bonds in the 
Binominal Model... Oh my god!!!


# Disclaimer

This API contains functionality to calculate prices, payoffs, probabilities of financial assets
like bonds, stocks, options, futures, etc... based on financial models like the binomial asset 
pricing model, CAPM etc.

The author of this API claims that he is not responsible for any losses, generated by investments 
which are based on any kind of calculations using this API. If your investment does not work out 
as calculated this may have two different reasons:

 1. No software is bug free. And so isn't this API.
 2. This API is based on financial models. And the propability that these financial models are absolutely
    nonsense is even higher than the propability that this API contains bugs.
